changes


major changes to design

add new features and fixed bugs 

added a login modal data fetched from an API, if wrong password or username is inputed you will get a message in the modal saying failed to login if the right password and username is entered the modal will close and you will be put back onto the site USERNAME - DevUser PASSWORD - Test@123

added new texts, headings, image and links to the home page. the texts all have text-to-speech enabled so if any text is clicked on the homepage text-to-speech will begin. the links which are attached to the logos below the "follow us!" heading take you to the SCNet social media account linked to that logo. (eg the instagram logo will take you to the SCnet Instagram account).

in the SA map stats section there is a new feature added that lets you filter to the province you want and once you select a province and confirm ,details of the selected province will show up from its icon.

in the health report section it displays corporate data fetched from the API given and there is an option to filter by corporate ID. there are also slight design changes.
